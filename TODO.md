- Principle - clear and specific instructions
1. Use delimeters ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :
1. ask for structured output
1. check if conditions are satisfied check assumptions required to do the task
1. few shot prompting - give succesful completion examples 
- Principle - give the model time to think
1. specify the steps to complete the task
1. hallucinations limitation
