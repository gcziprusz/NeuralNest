- Jupyter
  - Jupyter is an open-source project that provides a web-based interactive computing platform. It supports various programming languages, but it's most commonly used with languages like Python, R, and Julia.
  - The name "Jupyter" is derived from the three core programming languages it initially supported: Julia, Python, and R.

- stochastic gradient descent (sgd)
  - SGD is an iterative optimization algorithm that aims to minimize a cost function by updating the model parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. 
- Spyder
  - A free and open source scientific environment written in Python.
# T
- Tensor
  - A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices and is easily understood as a multidimensional array. A vector is a one dimensional or first order tensor and a matrix is a two dimensional or second order tensor.
- tensorflow
  - TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
